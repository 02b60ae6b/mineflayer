mineflayer - Minecraft game logic library and bot scripting interface.

Homepage: http://mineflayer.com

Setting up build:

    Linux:

        1. Install prerequisites: qt4-dev-tools
        2. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        3. qmake path/to/mineflayer.pro
        4. Now whenever you want to build, use make.

    Linux, headless mode (this removes dependency on an X server at all):

        Same thing as above Linux except for step 3 which is:
        3. EXTRA_CONFIG=headless qmake path/to/mineflayer.pro

    Linux, with 3D support:

        NOTE: 3D support currently only works in Linux

        1. Install prerequisites: libois-dev libogre-dev qt4-dev-tools
        2. Edit mineflayer.pro and follow instructions there for 3D support
        3. Run bin/extract_resources.sh <path_to_minecraft.jar>
        4. Manually copy resources/ to build directory
        5. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        6. qmake path/to/mineflayer.pro
        7. Now whenever you want to build, use make.

    Mac:

        1. Download the Qt SDK for Mac from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
        2. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        3. qmake -spec macx-g++ path/to/mineflayer.pro
        4. Now whenever you want to build, use make.

    Mac, headless mode (this removes dependency on user being logged in via UI):

        Same thing as above except for step 3, which is:
        3. EXTRA_CONFIG=headless qmake -spec macx-g++ path/to/mineflayer.pro

    Windows:

        NOTE: these instructions are out of date. You don't need to do step 5 or
              probably steps 2 - 6 at all.

        1. Download and install the Qt SDK: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
        2. Open mineflayer.pro with Qt Creator
        3. On the left click Projects.
        4. Edit build configuration: Release
        5. Build Steps -> qmake -> Details -> additional arguments: CONFIG+=no_3d
        6. On the left above the run button, change the active build to Release
        7. Build -> Build All
        8. This generates mineflayer.exe in your build directory. Typically
           you run bots from the command line. To do this you'll need to copy
           a bunch of DLLs from Qt. These DLLs are:
           * libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
           * mingwm10.dll
           * QtCore4.dll
           * QtGui4.dll
           * QtNetwork4.dll
           * QtScript4.dll
           * QtScriptTools4.dll

Running bots:

    ./mineflayer bot.js

    If the bot depends on any of the lib files you'll need to pass the lib
    folder like this:

    ./mineflayer -I<path_to_lib> bot.js

    Alternately, you can put the lib folder in an environment variable called
    MINEFLAYER_LIB. When we make an installer for this package, we'll have it
    set this stuff up automatically.

    To connect to a server that requires authentication:

    ./mineflayer --url username@server --password 12345 bot.js

    Note that all parameters passed after the bot .js file are
    parameters passed to the bot script itself rather than mineflayer.

    * See doc/bot-api for comprehensive API documentation.
    * See libs/ for more utility functions.
    * See examples/ for examples of bot code.
