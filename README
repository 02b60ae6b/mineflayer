Setting up build:

    Linux:

        1. Install prerequisites: libois-dev libogre-dev qt4-dev-tools
        2. Run ./extract_resources <path_to_minecraft.jar>
        3. Manually copy resources/ to build directory
        4. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        5. qmake path/to/mineflayer.pro
        6. Now whenever you want to build, use make.

    Linux, no 3D support (this removes dependency on ogre3d and OIS):
    
        1. Install prerequisites: qt4-dev-tools
        2. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        3. EXTRA_CONFIG=no_3d qmake path/to/mineflayer.pro
        4. Now whenever you want to build, use make.

    Linux, headless mode (this removes dependency on an X server at all):

        Same thing as no 3D support except use "headless" instead of "no_3d"

    Mac, no 3D support:

        Important: Currently 3D via Ogre doesn't work!
        
        1. Download the Qt SDK for Mac from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
        2. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        3. EXTRA_CONFIG=no_3d qmake -spec macx-g++ ../mineflayer/mineflayer.pro
        4. Now whenever you want to build, use make.
        
    Mac, headless mode (this removes dependency on user being logged in via UI):

        Same thing as no 3D support except use "headless" instead of "no_3d"

    Windows:

        TODO

Running bots:

./mineflayer bot.js

If the bot depends on any of the lib files you'll need to pass the lib folder
like this:

./mineflayer -I<path_to_lib> bot.js
