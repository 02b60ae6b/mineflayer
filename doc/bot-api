/**
 * Vocabulary
 *
 * meter - a block is 1 meter cubed, or 1x1x1.
 * x, y, z - East, North, Up respectively. Coordinates are always specified in meters.
 *          NOTE: this coordinate system is different from Notch's South-Up-West system.
 *          Use toNotchCoord() and fromNotchCoord() to translate between coordinate systems.
 *
 * 
 * Classes
 *
 * Point - You can instantiate one like this: mf.Point(x, y, z)
 *      x - east coordinate
 *      y - north coordinate
 *      z - up coordinate
 *
 * EntityState
 *      position {Point} The center of the bottom of of the entity.
 *      velocity {Point} The entity's velocity in meters per second squared.
 *      height {Number} [0.1, 1.65] How tall the entity is. For example if you crouch you are shorter.
 *      yaw {Number} [0, 2pi] Rotation around z axis. 0 is +x. pi/2 is +y. pi is -x. 3pi/2 is -y.
 *      pitch {Number} [-pi/2, pi/2] 0 is parallel to the ground. pi/2 is up. -pi/2 is down.
 *      roll {Number} [-pi, pi] Usually ignored. 0 is level. pi/2 is left ear pointing downward.
 *      on_ground {Boolean} True if you are not free-falling.
 *
 * mf.ItemType - the id of blocks and items. See the output of
 *               examples/reflect.js for a full listing of names.
 *
 * Enums (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
 * 
 * mf.Face - Which side of a block, if any.
 *     NoDirection
 *     NegativeX (West)
 *     PositiveX (East)
 *     NegativeY (South)
 *     PositiveY (North)
 *     NegativeZ (Down)
 *     PositiveZ (Up)
