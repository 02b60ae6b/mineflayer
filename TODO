Core:
 * partial block physics (slab, stairs, etc)
 * in-liquid physics
 * ladder physics
 * slippery ice physics

 * digging / placing blocks / attacking
 * time tracking (day / night)
 * crafting / inventory manipulation
 * non-spoken chat interpretation (player joined, etc)
 * clean up stray chunks that didn't get unloaded
 * recalculte light on block changes

Bot framework:
 * implement the functions in doc/bot-api
 * metadata access for blocks
 * command line parameters
 * get stack traces when javascript throws things

3D client:
 * chunk seams are broken
 * deleting chunks is broken
 * TOO SLOW
 * chatting 
 * digging
 * mobs/players/pickups
 * doors
 * torches and redstone torches
 * minecart tracks
 * ladders
 * stairs
 * levers
 * buttons
 * sign posts
 * wall signs
 * pressure plates
 * stone slab
 * cake
 * water/lava animation
 * water / lava flow
 * sky, sun, moon, day/night
